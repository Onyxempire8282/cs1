# üß™ Mileage Calculator Testing Instructions

## Quick Test (No Server Required)

**Step 1:** Open the diagnostic file directly in your browser
- Navigate to: `c:\Users\vlong\Projects\cs1\frontend\diagnostic-test.html`
- Double-click to open in your default browser
- OR drag and drop the file into a browser window

**Step 2:** Check the diagnostic results
- Look at the "System Diagnostic" section
- All items should show green "Good" or "Ready" status
- If you see red errors, that tells us what's broken

**Step 3:** Test the calculator
- Select "Sedgwick" as the firm
- Enter a destination like "Raleigh, NC" or "123 Main St, Cary, NC"  
- Click "üó∫Ô∏è Test Distance Calculation"
- Should show distance and billing automatically

## Advanced Test (With Local Server)

If the direct file approach doesn't work due to browser security, use the local server:

**Step 1:** Open PowerShell in the frontend directory
```powershell
cd c:\Users\vlong\Projects\cs1\frontend
```

**Step 2:** Install Node.js (if not installed)
- Download from: https://nodejs.org
- Choose the LTS version

**Step 3:** Start the test server
```powershell
node test-server.js
```

**Step 4:** Open browser to
```
http://localhost:3000
```
